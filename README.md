- Run `mainCompareAlgorithm.m` in folder `./Experiment 1 and 3-different strength and execution time` to validate experiment 1 and experiment 3 in the manuscript. The comparison of defense effectiveness and execution of RA, GH, RBA, CBG, and SSABG in Case #1-#4 can be found in `result_compare.xlsx`.
- Run `mainCompareAlgorithm.m` in folder `./Experiment 2-different p` to validate experiment 2 in the manuscript. The comparison of defense effectiveness of RA, GH, RBA, CBG and SSABG with different prior probability $P_1^A$ can be found in `result_compare.xlsx`.

This project is run by `Octave`.
